I am working as a Data Scientist for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. I have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables
